            <p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! I'm a thing. Why would a robot need to drink? Tell them I hate them.</p>
            <p>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew,
                Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I? <strong>" Then later, Leela made the film.</strong> <em> But
                    if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles.</em> Roll
                film!</p>
            <h2>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</h2>
            <p>I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like
                clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I''
                have to pay ''them'! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in
                your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</li>
                <li>And I'm his friend Jesus.</li>
                <li>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</li>
            </ol>
            <input type="text">

            <h3>And until then, I can never die?</h3>
            <p>I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.
                She also liked to shut up! Kif might! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad
                news!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li>
                <li>Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?</li>
                <li>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Just once I'd like to eat
                dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. A true inspiration for the children. We'll go
                deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</p>
            <p>I'm a thing. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Have you ever tried just turning off
                the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp.
                Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute
                little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>
            <p>And I'm his friend Jesus. Kids have names? You don't know how to do any of those. Ah, the 'Breakfast
                Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! In our darkest hour, we can
                stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</p>
            <p>Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. A true inspiration for the
                children. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download
                pornography.</p>
            <p>File not found. No, just a regular mistake. A true inspiration for the children. No! The cat shelter's on
                to me. Your best is an idiot!</p>
            <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable
                excuse! I asked you to get busy! Shinier than yours, meatbag. Noooooo! Why yes! Thanks for noticing.
                Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</p>
            <p>Negative, bossy meat creature! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't
                make sense. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. So, how 'bout them
                Knicks?</p>
            <p>I had more, but you go ahead. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Hey,
                guess what you're accessories to. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship.
                Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
            <p>Kids have names? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling
                errors! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest
                easier not knowing where they are.</p>
            <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Who are you, my warranty?! Ugh, it's filthy! Why
                not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? They're like sex, except I'm having
                them!</p>
            <p>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! No, just a regular mistake. Robot 1-X, save my
                friends! And Zoidberg! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be
                something you'd have to freebase.</p>
